## Introduction 

We’re excited to announce that we will be taking part in this year’s [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code)! We’re kicking off the event with a special party for our members. If you’ve been thinking about joining us and haven’t yet, now is your chance! There are going to be lots of fun—and surprises—in store for you at this celebration so don’t miss out on it!

## It is that time of the year again!

It is the time of the year again: open source month! This year we have something very special planned for you: hacktoberfest with Aviyel! hacktoberfest with Aviyel, a celebration of all things [open source](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#beginner-resources) from software to hardware—and beyond. Let’s work together to improve our community. There are many different ways that you can participate in this event: attend [events](https://aviyel.com/events) on the Aviyel platform; create awesome [technical content](https://aviyel.com/post/3639/mastering-the-art-of-technical-writing) using our platform; volunteer as an event organizer—host one of our events or meet us after.

## Aviyel participating for the first time

Open Source community is growing more diverse and energetic every day. No matter what your interests are or which field you work in—you will be able to find someone who can help you there. Open source software, advocacy efforts, and other collaborative projects benefit from the community that supports them. This backbone of support is what makes these endeavors possible—and that’s where Aviyel comes in.

Aviyel is committed to making open source software grow through awareness and adoption. Communities can use Aviyel's platform to keep in touch with the latest information, ask questions, and share their challenges—organizing online events for their own communities as well as extending the value of open source software in general.

## Hacktoberfest with Aviyel!

A month-long celebration where participants are prompted to contribute in ways other than writing code during this four-week period. We wanted to provide an avenue for people to connect, compete and collaborate with fellow open source enthusiasts. And on top of that, we’re providing mentors—giving creators a voice while also giving them assistance along the way. Here are some examples of how you can contribute:

**Write documentation for an existing project**. A good way to do this is by creating a new page in the wiki with details about the project, and adding any relevant information that you have found out while researching it. The more detailed your documentation is, the better it will be for people who are looking for help with the project.

**Create a tutorial or write an article for an existing project:** Tutorials and articles are important because they provide instructions on how to use a tool or service in a step-by-step manner. If you have experience using something, it's easy for others to follow along with your tutorial.

![Content Creation](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3dzhtp6ys769t7a1non1.png)

This can be especially helpful if the new user needs help getting started using your application or toolkits. If possible, create multiple articles and content so that there are several ways to learn about the product or service from different perspectives

**Create an API reference page for an open source project**: An API reference page contains links to all of the API calls and responses used by an application or library.
