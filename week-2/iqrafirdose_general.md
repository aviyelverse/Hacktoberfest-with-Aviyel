<h1>Why Technical Writing & Open Source Projects Should Be Unstoppable Combo.</h1>

## Introduction

Technical writing and Open Source are on the rise. Every project—new or old, large or small—needs technical documentation: from short user manuals to complex API specifications. If users can’t understand how to use something that was designed for them, they simply give up!

## What is open source?

An open-source project is one whose source code and documentation are freely accessible to the public. Anyone, not just software engineers and developers, can modify, study, and improve the project, and anyone, not just software engineers and developers, can contribute to open source projects.

**Technical writing with open source is an unstoppable combo**. Anyone starting with technical writing might be thinking of how to gain experience, how to apply learning to [real-world applications](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/real-world-application), what samples to add to your portfolio, and how to find a good position. The only solution is to start contributing to open-source projects.

## How do technical writers contribute to open-source projects?

- Find open-source programs
    - Try to find open-source programs that involve technical writing, documentation, and non-code contributions.
    - The best open-source program to start your technical writing is [Hacktoberfest with aviyel](https://aviyel.com/post/3738/announcing-hacktoberfest-with-aviyel).
- Find a project you can contribute to.
    - Find open-source projects that have documentation issues and those projects that don’t contain clear documentation because many open-source projects are incomplete and confusing. For example, if you are interested in React, try to find open-source projects that use React because you have knowledge about how to solve problems and create applications in React.

 - Identify an issue to be solved.
    - After finding an open-source project, identify an issue that involves documentation. Most open-source programs have open issues related to their documentation.
    - If you find it, notify the maintainer that you want to contribute to this project and start working on it.
    - If you don’t find the issues, then find projects in which documentation can be added or improved. Then raise the issue and start writing about it.

- Send a pull request
    - Review your documentation and adhere to their contribution and style guides before submitting a pull request.

## Conclusion

Documentation helps new members orient themselves on how to use a project, how to contribute, and the terms of use—allowing them to understand better what you're trying to achieve. This makes documentation key for understanding an open-source project's vision.
