## Introduction

This article reviews some of the no-code tools available for building and testing [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)‚ÄîApplication Programming Interfaces. The following list of tools is not ranked in any particular order. Although this article discusses only seven tools, there are actually more in existence than those mentioned below. The choice of tool often depends on the situation at hand‚Äîthough each has its own strengths and weaknesses, as we shall see shortly.

## What is an API?

API stands for Application Program Interface, which acts as an intermediary between two applications to communicate with each other. For example, every time we check the current weather or sign up/in on a website‚Äîwe use API's.

Let us consider a real-life example to understand the workings of APIs even better:

- Say that you go to a restaurant and look at the menu to order food (Request-Web App/Client).
- Then you call the waiter to take the order (API).
- Then the waiter enters the kitchen and tells the chef to cook food. (Backend/Server)
- The waiter then delivers the food after it is prepared (Response).

Now, with this basic understanding, let‚Äôs look at different [no-code](https://www.integrate.io/blog/what-is-no-code/) tools to build and test APIs.

## List of tools available ‚öíÔ∏è

## 1. Appsmith

[Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com/) is an open source platform to build apps, starting from initializing a data source to deployment, with all the required features in between. It can connect to any DB source, ranging from [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), or connect with APIs of any format, like [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) or [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). CRUD operations can be performed with ease using Appsmith. There are prebuilt UI widgets and templates available for users to build the front end that is customizable as well. Specific theme properties are available to make your apps customized for your brand. The addition of an inbuilt JS editor has the added benefit of making individual widgets interact with each other. Deploying an application within the Appsmith cloud environment is made easy, but one can also take advantage of any other hosting services. Also, we can collaborate with other team members using¬†[version control](https://git-scm.com/). Therefore, the Appsmith dashboard serves as a central resource to control all things without the need for multiple platforms.

## 2. Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a platform to build and test APIs. Its main focus is to facilitate the API lifecycle and collaboration with other developers, making it fast and simple. It's available online and can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It provides services like API repositories, tools, governance, workspaces, and integrations to facilitate the API life cycle.

## 3. Keploy

[Keploy](https://keploy.io/)¬†is a no-code API testing platform that takes care of writing tests for all possible methods, which are difficult to write manually and run in production environments. Say you are using third-party apps, then Keploy mocks their response. It helps us improve the application by comparing the current update with the previous update to give a clear overview of where our application needs attention. Features like reports, alerts, etc., add more functionality to the platform.

## 4. NoCode API

[NoCodeAPI](https://nocodeapi.com/)¬†is made for¬†[integration](https://nocodeapi.com/marketplace/) with third-party apps like Sheets, Airtable, Firebase, Notion, Slack, etc. It is no code and makes it easy without writing server-side code. It also caches our requests, which helps us bypass rate limiting. Every endpoint is separated into multiple projects, which makes organization easier. Collaboration is made easier with other developers and team members. The latest feature also adds domain security to secure the APIs.

## 5. Presto API

[Presto API](https://prestoapi.com/)¬†eliminates the need for the backend and provides more work on the front end. The workflow is based on 3 steps:

- Connectüîó
- Customize‚öôÔ∏è
- Build‚öíÔ∏è

Connect with the target database, customize the API methods for performing CRUD operations, and build APIs without needing to write backend code. One of the limitations is that it supports only SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Oracle. One of the advantages is that its UI is based on [swagger](https://swagger.io/), so it's familiar to most developers.

## 6. Xano

[Xano](https://www.xano.com/)¬†is a scalable no-code backend and API builder. It works on the parameters:

- BuildüèóÔ∏è
- Launch‚åö
- Scale‚öñÔ∏è

We could build business logic, automate tasks, launch the backend without the need for servers, and be highly scalable to support any number of users. It also has a¬†[no-code API builder](https://docs.xano.com/api/api-builder)¬†that supports simple to complex CRUD operations. It works based on:

We could build business logic, automate tasks, and launch the backend without using servers. It also has a no-code API builder that supports simple to complex CRUD operations‚Äîand everything works based on:

- Inputs‚å®Ô∏è
- The Function Stack‚ÜóÔ∏è
- Responseüîî

## 7. Canonic

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81156510/201162986-aafb4425-d475-4253-bf49-20e3222011bd.png)

[Canonic](https://canonic.dev/) is best suited for businesses to create complete backend systems for web apps, mobile apps, and microservices. It aims to provide services that a developer needs even if the person is not a developer. It has special features like identity login, workflow automation, scheduled triggers, CMS, etc.

## Conclusion

All these tools are no-code, which means that you don't need to be a developer in order to use them. These mostly focus on simplifying the server side‚Äîwhich can be time-consuming and hectic‚Äîso they're especially helpful if we want to leverage our resources efficiently and effectively!
