## Introduction:

Novu, described in the [official documentation](https://docs.novu.co/overview/introduction/) as a "notification infrastructure," is built to enable engineering teams to build rich notification experiences without constantly reinventing them.

The primary goal of Novu is to provide an all-in-one communication layer between the product and its users. Using Novu, business owners can now send emails, SMS, push notifications, in-app notifications, etc. without going through the hassle of implementing each service individually.

## Why are notification services necessary for businesses?

The main purpose behind sending email notifications to your users or customers is to notify them about the various updates, changes, or additions to your product or service. Not only does this help you in promoting and marketing your product, but it also helps you in informing your customers about the latest changes and keeping them updated.

## Problems faced by businesses:

Let’s say you own an e-commerce app just like Amazon. And suppose you want to promote a product or notify your users about an upcoming sale on your platform. How would you notify them? Through emails and push notifications, right? However, you cannot send notifications or emails individually. As a result, you'll need a service that can help you send these to all of your customers at once. There are numerous platforms on the internet that allow you to do so, including Mailchimp, Nodemailer, Twilio, Expo Push, and others.

But different platforms provide different services. Twilio can help you in sending SMS, while expo push helps you with your push notifications—does that mean we have to integrate each of them individually if we want to send text messages and notifications alerts?

Yes. Let’s say you integrated each of these services individually. But what happens if one of them goes down? That's exactly where [Novu](https://novu.co/) comes into play

## What makes novu simple and convenient to use:

Novu provides its users with a single API to manage all their user and customer communication. They have built a smart API that tends to centralize all communication channels in a single place, be it email, SMS, push notifications, etc.

Do you need to send emails or SMS? Novu has got it covered for you.

Novu helps you with switching different email providers to SMS providers, templates, and more.

Integrating Novu just needs a few simple steps.

To start using [Novu](https://web.novu.co/), you will need to [create an account](https://web.novu.co/auth/signup). Then connect the [providers](https://web.novu.co/integrations) that you would like to integrate with.

Fill in the required private keys, ID, name, URL, and other necessary details needed by the providers.

Then, create a custom notification template that you would want to send to your users.

Finally, send an event trigger using the built-in SDK from your API.

Voila! You’re done! That’s all it takes—Novu will take care of the rest.

Novu supports a number of services like Twilio, Mailgun, Postmark, sendgrid, Plivo, Mailjet, Nodemailer, etc. Therefore, if one service goes down, you always have the option to switch to another—thereby increasing your reliability.

## Conclusion:

Sending notifications or having notifications for your business—like emails or sms—does not have to be complicated and can be integrated with only a few clicks and very few lines of code with Novu. Novu is built in a way to take care of the heavy lifting of sending the notification on your behalf. And if you ever want to switch providers, it is as easy and straightforward as a few simple steps, with no code changes needed!
