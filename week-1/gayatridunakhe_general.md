## **Introduction**

We all know about **Open Source** and most of us are trying to contribute to open source projects to enhance projects and also our skills. When we talk about Open Source, most people think, "We only contribute as developers or coders,", but very few people know about **Non-Code Contributions**.

The question that may arise here is "What are non-code contributions?" and "Who can contribute to open source as a non-code?" and "What are the ways to contribute to open source without writing a single line of code?"

## **What are non–code contributions?**

Non-code contributions to open source projects can include writing documentation, creating graphics, arranging meetings and managing resources. I will explain how this is done further in the article.

## **Who can contribute to open source as a non-code?**

Honestly, anyone can start contributing to open source. Be specific for non-coders, those with interests and skills such as:

- Community Management
- Graphic Designers / UX / UI Developers
- Content writers
- Those who have an interest in Testing things
- Those have the ability to manage documents, etc

We discuss what non-code contributions are and who can make them. But how should you go about contributing to open source without writing code? Don’t worry—I have the 10 best ways to contribute to open source for non-code contributions!

## **1. Community Management**

There are many communities in this world that require people to help them manage community work. So you can also contribute there as a community manager, or for any other role. You can manage community events, manage community resources, host meets, arrange one-to-one conferences, etc.

## **2. Contribute Through Designing**

You can also contribute as a designer to open source projects. Besides helping people make meeting posters and video thumbnails, you can also help with other design tasks—like making promotion posters or social media posts for events in open source communities. And people who have skills in video editing and animation can also contribute by creating videos or animations about projects, so that these presentations are more effective and engaging.

## **3. Helping to Make Documentation**

You can also contribute to open source by just helping people to make documentation and maintaining their documentation of the projects, API’s, and other project-related features. In that, you can create documentation of projects that elaborates on what the project is, how it will work, what its requirements are, features of projects, etc.

## **4. Answer Others Questions**

Here, you can contribute simply by answering other people's questions or solving their problems. You can also do this on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and try to solve issues on GitHub repos as well. First, read the questions carefully so that you understand what they're asking and think over how to solve their problem. Then explain your solution in writing—or better yet, do an actual demonstration!

## **5. Review Other Code/Documentation**

Reviewing other people's code is the most effective way to contribute to any open source project. Reviewing, suggesting changes, and finding bugs are a great way for anyone with knowledge of one programming language (or more!) to start helping out an open source community by making small—but important—changes. For example, giving them suggestions, finding bugs, reviewing, etc.!

## **6. Sharing Ideas With Others**

Lots of people have so many amazing ideas related to projects or anything related to real-world problems. So if you don’t know how to implement things, you can share your ideas with other people and get help from them. You can execute your ideas and solve real-world problems easily as well as learn from them.

## **7. Writing Blogs/ Content**

You can also contribute by writing blogs or content on any topic related to projects or any technology, about future things, etc. You can write your thoughts about it and also help others understand the specific concepts even better.

## **8. Helping In Improving User Experience(UX)**

If you enjoy conducting surveys, spotting flaws in product interfaces, and interacting with end users—this is the job for you. You can improve user experiences for applications or open source projects by carrying out these activities

## **9. Contribute As A Tester**

You can test the application, documents of a project, or anything where you want to contribute. You help them find bugs in their product/application by providing constructive criticism and helping fix problems.

## **10. Teaching Others**

Last but not least, this is also the best way to contribute to open source. You can teach people about any particular concept by sharing your thoughts about technology through educational videos and posts on any platform. You can make a simple tutorial for any application you use, any software, or anything, and let others know what it is, how it works, and what its purpose of existence is.

## **Conclusion**

That’s all I have for now. There are so many ways to contribute to open source, and wherever that may be something where you feel comfortable contributing is a good place to start—you'll surely find something that interests you! Always stay curious about things, learn anything new whenever possible; don't forget about contributing back (though).

Thank you!!
