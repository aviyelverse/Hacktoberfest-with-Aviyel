## Introduction

Anyone starting a career in tech, it's important to decide which areas you want to explore—some people pursue web application development while others pursue application development. But no matter what path you choose, every "developer"—regardless of experience level—should have some understanding of frontend and backend technologies.

Let’s look into it by taking an example. Let’s say that you know how to drive a car and that you have a luxurious car. When you drive the car, you only know that when you press the engine button, the engine revs up and your car starts. When you turn the steering wheel, the car turns in that direction, and when you press the brake, your car stops. Well, that’s just the basics, and everyone knows that. But what everyone does not know is how the engine actually starts just by pressing the button. How the car stops just by pressing the brakes, and how it turns just by turning the steering.

This is exactly the difference between the **frontend** and **backend**.

The **frontend** is the part of the application that is visible to its user. It is the part of the development cycle that deals with the creation and development of elements and features of an application that involve user interaction.

In the car example that we took earlier, the engine button is the element or feature that starts the car. The brakes are the feature that brings the vehicle to a halt.

On the other hand, the **backend** is the part of the application that is not visible to the users. It is a part of the development cycle that deals with developing the functionality behind the features of the application. In the car example that we took, the exact functionality behind how the engine starts just by pressing the start engine button is handled by the backend developers.

**So, in terms of an application, what exactly are frontend and backend?**

A frontend developer develops the user interface of an application. For example, in a flight booking system, the button that books your flight just by clicking it is part of the frontend.

> Note: A frontend developer is not a designer. A designer is the person who draws the way the application would look when it was completely built, either on a piece of paper or using applications like Photoshop or Figma.

The job of the front-end developer is to deal with the "client-side" of the application by creating the visual elements of the website. It is mainly focused on what the user sees when they visit the application or a website.

They usually take the design of the application from the UI/UX designers and bring the application to life. Some of the basic work of frontend developers is to build the buttons, layouts, and animations and deal with the organization of the content of the application. The generic tech stack used by a frontend developer is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS(Cascading stylesheet), and JavaScript.

HTML defines the structure of the application, CSS gives life to this structure by adding styles and colors to it, and JavaScript controls the behavior of the application.

A very well-known example is shown below:

Not to scare you away, but taking humans as an example, HTML is the bone structure or the skeleton, and the nervous system, which controls the way in which different parts behave, is what javascript does. where CSS is our overall appearance.

A backend developer develops the functionality of the application. On a flight booking application, when you click the "book my flight" button, it stores your information in the database, checks if the flight is available, and books a slot under your name. All this stuff takes place behind the scenes, i.e., at the backend of your application, without you knowing that this kind of stuff is happening.

The backend development is the "server-side" of your application. It includes a server, which provides the data according to the requests made and contains the logic as to what should be provided when you click on different elements on the frontend. The server is also responsible for arranging the data and storing it in the database.

It is the part of the application that is not visible to the users, so a user cannot communicate with it or interact with it directly. The functionalities developed by the backend developers are accessed and put to use by the frontend developers.

The tech stack used in the backend portion can vary from application to application. Some may use programming languages like Java; some may use Node.js or Python. For databases, some may use non-relational databases like MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and Redis, while others may use relational databases like SQL.

## Conclusion

Therefore, the frontend developers create elements on the client side that interact with some of the functionalities developed by the backend developers. And these two parts put together, form an application that we can see and use ourselves (well, there are a number of other teams too, like the operations team and the testing team, but let’s not get into that).

All in all, the frontend and backend of an application are like the two sides of a coin; someone who understands how to create applications from both perspectives is called a "full-stack developer."
