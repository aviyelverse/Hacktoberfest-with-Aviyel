## Introduction

The world of technology and innovation is constantly evolving and growing rapidly. It’s very important to keep up with the changes in order to avoid being left behind. Easier said than done, right?

While keeping up sounds like an easy task, it’s actually not easy to keep up with the changes. It’s very easy to get overwhelmed with a lot of changes and information available out there.

However, keeping up with new changes will help you grow in the field. Therefore, it’s very important to know how to be up-to-date with new frameworks, best practices, new programming languages, softwares, and other bizarre changes in the tech industry. In this article, you are going to learn about some of the tips I used to keep up-to-date with the recent happenings and changes in the tech industry.

## Tip 1: Follow Tech Newsletters and Company’s News Digest

Newsletters are really a great way to learn about new stuff or products that are currently out there. Most tech companies that create software, tools, and frameworks send out newsletters to their users informing them of changes or improvements to their products.

Most developers and blogs also issue newsletters curated by them that contain news about changes in the tech industry. For example, [[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)](https://stackoverflow.com/), [[Aviyel](https://aviyel.com/)](https://aviyel.com/), [[Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)](https://hashnode.com/), and [[Freecodecamp,](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to mention a few, usually send out really great newsletters on a periodic and regular basis about the changes and new stuff in the industry.

These newsletters are usually well-curated and easy to read and follow. They are literally gathering all the information you need for you. All you need to do is lie back, grab a cup of coffee and read.

## Tip 2: Attend Conferences and Events

Conferences and events are used to bring together people with similar interests and debate problems and concepts pertaining to a particular topic. If you are passionate about career growth, attending conferences and events should be a priority for you. This pretty much applies to every field you are in—not just tech alone. Tech conferences, events, and meetups have been known to be really useful to techies, not just in getting informed, but also in getting jobs and making meaningful connections.

## Tip 3: Be Curious

Curiosity is defined as the ability to seek and acquire new knowledge, skills, and ways of understanding the world.

Albert Einstein once said, "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious. " He also said, "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."

The technology field is a field that demands curiosity in order to grow. Being able to ask the right questions is a really good skill to have.

To be successful in tech, you have to be ready to be a lifelong learner and keep your curiosity intact. Because no matter what level or how skilled you are, there is always something new to learn.

## Tip 4: Be Active on Social Media Platforms (especially Twitter)

In recent years, social media platforms have grown to be useful for much more than just fun. Most companies and products make announcements on their social media platforms; it's often the first place they'll post news or updates about new developments.

By being active on social media platforms, you expand your network and meet new people from different backgrounds as well.

## Tip 5: Work on Side-Projects

Software development is a skill, like any other. And just as athletes train their bodies to perform well in competition by practicing constantly, so too must developers practice programming daily if they wish to succeed in the workplace.

There are two acronyms that can help you keep your skills up-to-date in the rapidly changing world of software development: ABC—Always Be Coding—and ABB—Always Be Building.

The importance of consistent practice in software development cannot be emphasized enough. To practice, you need to put into use the knowledge you have gathered and acquired from various sources. Working on real-world projects makes this possible.

When you work on new projects, you get to learn new things and discuss new ways to solve problems. Also, working on side projects makes you engage in extensive research, which will, in turn, build up your knowledge base and problem-solving skills over time.

## Conclusion

You have just read about some of the tips I use to keep up-to-date with the changes in the software industry. However, it should be noted that it’s not all shiny tools and frameworks that one needs to learn and use.

Here are other things you might try out:

- Become an active member of the tech community.
- Contribute to Open Source and be open to collaboration.
- Participate in Hackathons.
