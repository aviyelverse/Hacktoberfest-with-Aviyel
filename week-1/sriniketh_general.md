## Introduction**🔊**

In general, a developer tries to use almost all the tips and tricks to be as productive as possible at all times. Staying productive, in any case, refers to utilizing the developer's resources. As a result, every developer tests some of the tricks they discover on social media tests tricks that have worked for others, and try something new (thinking out of the box). These tips may not only help a new developer, but they have proven to be successful for any developer around the world; the only difference is the tip(s). This is a must-read topic for anyone initially venturing out into the developer world because many feel inundated, go through imposter syndrome, find it hard to keep up with new trends, and so on.

## What does “being productive” mean to a software developer?⌚

Staying productive at all times means producing more than the expected output at all times. Is productivity solely measured in terms of time? In the majority of cases, the answer is yes. Every developer will strive to complete the task in the shortest amount of time possible. The same is true for resolving DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms) and CP(Competitive Programming) problems. Hence, time management is the most important must-master skill other than any technical skill to stay productive.

## Productivity Hacks📃

Here I have provided the top seven best tips and tricks that have been tried and tested and proven to improve productivity as a developer:

### Work🔨 → Recharge🔋 → Work🔨

This endless, infinite loop of work and recharge has worked for ages. The main focus here is recharge because it varies from person to person, such as having a cup of coffee, taking a short 10-minute nap, listening to soothing music, and so on. This varies from person to person and must be tested to determine which hack works best.

### → Timetable📅

An age-old practice starting from our schooling is to be inculcated to get the most out of the prescribed time. This imposes a strict deadline for completing the work, making us appreciate the value of time at all times.

### → 80-20 Rule💯

Also known as the Pareto Principle, it states that 80% of your outcome arrives only due to 20% of your effort. Therefore, this leads us to a stage where we need to prioritize the tasks that add meaning to the outcome we get. Think of a day where you spend the entire 8 hours working on a project or an assigned task but have nothing in hand in terms of output to show at the end. So, conclusively, perform meaningful tasks initially and then contribute towards small tasks.

### → Biological Prime Time⏲️

Everyone feels more proactive at different times of the day. Assume your body feels completely supported when you work at 10 p.m., and you produce faster and better results at that time. So, in order to produce better results, perform tasks that are both tedious and important. This has personally worked for many folks whom I know. It could be early in the morning, at midnight, or at noon; choose the time that works best for you and plan your day accordingly.

### → Maintain Streak🔥

Most of you try to maintain Snapchat streaks and feel disheartened if you fail it. So, why not keep a streak(s) of GitHub, Leetcode, and so on according to your work type and instill the habit of doing some work related to it even if there is no or very little requirement? However, keep in mind that even the smallest contribution adds value.

### → Preplanned📆

This is sometimes referred to as being highly ambitious, but this trick is the most recommended one and at the same time the most difficult to master as well. Planning what has to be done for the next day is known as preplanning, and the order in which these tasks will be performed matters. Also, we cannot expect every day to be the same, so the day might not go as planned. You have to be ready for everything and make modifications accordingly to accomplish the pre-planned things.

### → Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY Principle)🔂

It is the art of saving time by reusing and recycling the work already done. In Feynman's terms, using a template or platform and editing it as per requirements Using pre-built things and working on top of them significantly reduces your time, and thereby you can witness better outcomes. There are many applications that entirely automate daily admin, including arranging meetings, keeping track of time, and taking minutes. This technique can also be used to get rid of low-value, repetitive tasks. It all boils down to making extra time and mental space for difficult and significant tasks.

## Conclusion🔚

These hacks are one-half of being productive. Regardless of these hacks, being a productive developer requires self-motivation and hard work. Also, to be clear, it's not all these tips and tricks to follow. It's a brief about what has worked for others, and unfortunately, it may not work for you due to various external factors. Therefore, feel free to test before deciding which will work and which may not.
