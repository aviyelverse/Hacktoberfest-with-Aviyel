<h1>Top 10 Best Ways to Teach Yourself How to Code</h1>
<h1> Introduction</h1>

Every person must try to learn how to code because coding helps us create new ideas and develop problem-solving skills. Many companies and startups hire coders—giving them a boost in business. Here I'll tell you the right way to teach yourself how to code.

## 1. Interest

Start your coding journey if you really like to code and you are interested in learning to code. Don’t force yourself into learning if it isn't something that interests you—other domains are there for the taking! If what you're doing feels like a piece of cake, then that's probably a good sign.

How to know whether you are interested to learn to code:

- Explore the coding domain
- Spend two to three months researching various options—for example, technical blogs or online classes..

## 2. Choose a language

To learn to code, you need a language to communicate with the computer. There are many [programming languages](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/types-of-programming-languages) available; pick one and understand the basics of the language.

**How to choose a programming language:**

- Learn the language of your interested domain
- Choose [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) or [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) as your first language

## 3. Follow one Resource

There are many resources available on the internet, but be careful not to fall into Tutorial Hell! Start with the documentation from the main website and follow one tutorial or course; once you understand that code, don't move on until you fully understand that specific topic.

### How to learn from resources:

- Build different projects with the same language/library.
- Try to add more features to the project.

## 4. Build Projects([Learn by Doing](https://www.lifehack.org/898427/learning-by-doing))

You can learn to code by building projects. Building real-world applications with concepts you've learned is a great way to reinforce your knowledge and gain experience from working on the actual software/applications.

### How to get ideas to build projects:

- Find a problem then build a solution.
- Know the need for the application.

## 5. Open Source

Open source projects are often collaborative efforts, allowing for faster and more efficient software development. You can learn about different programming techniques by studying the source code of various open-source programs, as well as contribute your own ideas to help improve upon existing applications. There are many communities and programs promoting open source. You can check with [aviyel](https://aviyel.com/discussions), for example.

## 6. Hackathons

Hackathons are events where programmers collaborate together to build projects in a fixed amount of time. You can learn to code by participating in hackathons. It gives an idea of how to build an application in a short amount of time.

## 7. Teach others

Someone said, “*You memorize things for a long time when you explain to others”.* When you explain concepts to others, it helps you better understand and remember them. Share your ideas with friends or family members—and ask for their thoughts too!

## 8. Create content

Creating content helps you learn how to code. You try new things in order to publish your work, and that learning experience can help you retain more information long-term than an equivalent book or video class would. You can create content on many platforms. You can share the content in the form of *blogs, threads, etc*.

## 9. Make videos, podcasts

Create videos, and share your learnings via video. Learning to code is easier when you can see it happening instead of just reading instructions or listening to someone talk. Develop a broader understanding of the domain by podcasting with other folks who are learning too—you’ll both be able to ask questions that would have been hard in text-only conversations

## 10. Involve in communities

Communities help us to grow together. You can give talks on being a part of communities, and how it has helped your coding journey. Communities also help you connect with people around the globe!

## Conclusion

Learning to code is a never-ending process. You have to learn new things every day. You have to upskill yourself. In the beginning, getting stuck or asking for help is normal in the coding journey. You cannot learn in one night; it takes *time and patience*. I hope the above ways help you to start your coding journey. Coding is a valuable skill that can help you grow as a person, even if you think it's too difficult. Kickstart your coding journey—learning never ends!
